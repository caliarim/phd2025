# PhD course 2025 -- Advances in Numerical Analysis and Mathematical Modelling: exponential integrators for systems of Ordinary Differential Equations

Lecturers: **Marco Caliari** and **Fabio Cassini**

This advanced course explores the theory, development, and
application of exponential integrators in the numerical solution of stiff
systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key topics are:
* introduction to Exponential Integrators: Overview of traditional;
* methods and the motivation for using exponential integrators for stiff;
* systems of ODEs;
* advanced Numerical Methods: Krylov subspace methods and other;
* polynomial or rational numerical techniques for approximating matrix functions, also in large-scale systems;
* implementation Techniques: Practical considerations for implementing exponential integrators on modern computer systems;
* applications to Advection-Diffusion-Reaction and Schr√∂dinger equations, among others.

This intensive course will include lectures and laboratory sessions.
Attendees will gain both theoretical understanding and practical
experience, ensuring they leave equipped with modern tools for numerical
ODE analysis.

It is preferred to have some knowledge of standard explicit and implicit
numerical methods for initial value ordinary differential equations
(Euler's methods, Runge-Kutta methods, theta-method) and evolutionary
partial differential equations (finite difference method).

The schedule is the following:
* Every Thursday, from January 16 to February 20, from 10:30 to 12:30, EXCLUDED February 6;
* Every Monday, from January 27 to February 24, from 14:30 to 16:30.
